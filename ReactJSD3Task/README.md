# React Demo Project

Create a React+Redux web application based on D3 library

#### Assignment

  - Create a single Page Analytics Dashboard using D3, React and Redux
  - User should be able to create and save graphs locally
  - There should be 3-5 types of data streams
  - For each graph user can choose the data stream, graph type and plot it
  - You can add as many graph types as you want like Line Graph Pie Chart Scatter plot. More the better
  - Mix and match different data streams and different graph types
  - Load Data from either Mock Rest API or static JSON file with flexibility to modify data without changing code
  - Optionally show the data used for plotting graph in a tabular component below
  - Strong emphasis should be on creating Clean and Intuitive Interface 
  - Design should look polished and complete
  
#### Libraries/Frameworks to use
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) for Components
*  [Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for bootstraping
* [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for creating responsive layout can be used if required
  
##### Directions

- Feel free to choose existing libraries that are well documented and popular for eg react-d3-graph, react-d3-components etc. At the least go through their examples to understand the different types of graphs possible
- Ideal time to finish the project would be 3-5 days
- Email if you have any queries/doubts
- The project is open ended so try to do few Great things then Many Ordinary things
- You should have fun building it. 
- If its not finished submit it anyways. 


##### Before you start
   - Drop an email at kartik@rxlab.solutions with the following details: Name, College, Resume, Proficient Skills, when you will start the project and tentative problem statement/features you intend to finish as part of the task
    
##### After you finish
- Upload the code on Github/Bitbucket and share the link on email.
- There should be a file detailing how to setup the project, run the code/tests and any other intructions. 
- Screenshots of the running screens should be shared on email

##### Bonus

- Create Unit Tests for the components if time permits
- Make the system as customisable as possible 
- Maximum choices for graph and data streams
