# Automated Tests

Create a TEST Suite for a NodeJS based REST API application

#### Assignment

  - Create a NodeJS Based REST API Service with 3-5 end points
  - Optionally use mongodb as a persistance layer
  - Create Automated tests for the application using any Testing framework of your choice
  - Use ES6/ES7 for writing code
  - There should be asynchronous code in the API preferably using async/await
  

##### Directions
-  Test Should cover Asynchronous functionality like DB Query or File Handling or similar functionality
- Create Test Data and include instructions to import this data 
- Ideal time to finish the project would be 3-5 days
- Email if you have any queries/doubts
- The project is open ended so try to do few Great things then Many Ordinary things
- You should have fun building it. 
- If its not finished submit it anyways. 

##### Before you start
   - Drop an email at kartik@rxlab.solutions with the following details: Name, College, Resume, Proficient Skills, tentative problem statement/features you intend to finish as part of the task and when you will start the project 
    
##### After you finish
- Upload the code on Github/Bitbucket and share the link on email.
- There should be a file detailing how to setup the project, run the tests and any other intructions. 
- A small video of tests running successfully would be helpful

##### Bonus

- Isolate your testing environment and test data using Docker if time permits
