# Elastic stack Dev

Create a Logging Service for a NodeJS based REST API application using Elastic Stack

#### Assignment

  - Create a NodeJS Based REST API Service with 3-5 end points
  - Optionally use mongodb as a persistance layer
  - Create a logging Service using Elastic Stack (ELK)
  - All logs from the service should be displayed on Kibana Dashboard
  

##### Directions
-  Focus on the technologies in this link [Elastic Search Logging Service](https://www.elastic.co/solutions/logging)
- Ideal time to finish the project would be 3-5 days
- Email if you have any queries/doubts
- The project is open ended so try to do few Great things then Many Ordinary things
- You should have fun building it. 
- If its not finished submit it anyways. 

##### Before you start
   - Drop an email at kartik@rxlab.solutions with the following details: Name, College, Resume, Proficient Skills, tentative problem statement/features you intend to finish as part of the task and when you will start the project 
    
##### After you finish
- Upload the code on Github/Bitbucket and share the link on email.
- There should be a file detailing how to setup the project, run the system and any other intructions. 
- A small video of code running successfully would be helpful

##### Bonus

- Use Docker images from https://hub.docker.com instead of downloading each service and setting them up manually
- Use Docker composer file for handling all configurations and connections
- Categorising different types of logs like error logs, access logs, db logs etc on Kibana Dashboard would be great
